# 🚀 GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## ✅ Step 1: Local Git Repository - COMPLETED
Your local repository is initialized and committed!

```
✓ Git initialized
✓ Files staged
✓ Initial commit created (f1e8567)
✓ 9 files committed, 1225 lines added
```

## 📋 Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

### Option A: Using GitHub Website (Recommended)

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com/new

2. **Repository Settings**:
   - **Repository name**: `whisperx-offline` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: "WhisperX offline video transcription with privacy protection"
   - **Visibility**: 
     - ✅ **Public** - If you want to share it
     - ✅ **Private** - If you want to keep it private
   - ⚠️ **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README" (we already have one)
   - ⚠️ **DO NOT** add .gitignore (we already have one)

3. **Click "Create repository"**

### Option B: Using GitHub CLI (if installed)

```bash
gh repo create whisperx-offline --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## 📤 Step 3: Push to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, you'll see instructions. Run these commands:

### If you haven't set up a remote yet:

```bash
# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/whisperx-offline.git

# Rename branch to main (GitHub's default)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Full command sequence:
```powershell
# Example (replace YOUR_USERNAME):
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/whisperx-offline.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔐 Authentication

When pushing, you'll need to authenticate with GitHub:

### Option 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "WhisperX Project"
4. Select scopes: `repo` (all)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)
7. Use it as your password when pushing

### Option 2: GitHub Desktop
- Download: https://desktop.github.com/
- Sign in and publish repository

### Option 3: SSH Keys
- Follow: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh

## ✅ Verification

After pushing successfully, you should see:
```
Enumerating objects: 12, done.
Counting objects: 100% (12/12), done.
...
To https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/whisperx-offline.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.
```

## 🎯 What's Included in Your Repository

Your repository contains:
- ✅ `main.py` - Core transcription script
- ✅ `confidential_terms.py` - Privacy configuration
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- ✅ `README.md` - Full documentation
- ✅ `PRIVACY_GUIDE.md` - Privacy features guide
- ✅ `PRIVACY_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Technical details
- ✅ `PRIVACY_SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - Quick start
- ✅ `test_sanitization.py` - Testing tool
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Excludes videos and outputs

## 🚫 What's NOT Included (Protected by .gitignore)

- ❌ Video files (*.mp4, *.mkv, etc.)
- ❌ Transcription outputs (*.txt)
- ❌ Sanitized outputs (*_sanitized.txt)
- ❌ Virtual environment (venv/)
- ❌ Cache files (.cache/, __pycache__/)

## 📝 Next Steps After Pushing

1. **Add Topics** on GitHub:
   - whisperx
   - transcription
   - speech-to-text
   - privacy
   - python

2. **Add a License** (optional):
   - Go to your repo → Add file → Create new file
   - Name it: `LICENSE`
   - Choose a license (MIT recommended)

3. **Enable Issues** (if you want feedback):
   - Settings → Features → Issues

## 🔄 Future Updates

When you make changes:

```bash
# Check status
git status

# Add changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Description of changes"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- ✅ Your `.gitignore` is properly configured
- ✅ No sensitive data (videos/transcriptions) will be pushed
- ✅ Only source code and documentation are tracked
- ⚠️ Update your email in git config if needed:
  ```bash
  git config --global user.email "your.real.email@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Real Name"
  ```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"
- Use a Personal Access Token (not password)
- Or set up SSH keys

### "Repository not found"
- Check the repository URL is correct
- Make sure you created the repository on GitHub first

### "Permission denied"
- Check you're logged into the correct GitHub account
- Verify the repository exists and you have access
