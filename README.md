### System Dependencies

#### FFmpeg Installation

FFmpeg is required to extract audio from video files.

#### Windows
**Method 1: Using winget (Recommended for Windows 10/11)**
```powershell
winget install --id Gyan.FFmpeg -e --source winget
```
After installation, **restart your terminal** for PATH changes to take effect.

**Method 2: Manual Installation**
1. Download FFmpeg from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
2. Extract the archive to a location (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg`)
3. Add the `bin` folder to your system PATH
4. Restart your terminal

**Verify Installation**:
```powershell
ffmpeg -version
```

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

#### macOS
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

**Note**: The `main.py` script is pre-configured to automatically find FFmpeg on Windows systems installed via winget. If you installed FFmpeg manually or in a custom location, you may need to update the FFmpeg path in the script.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before installing the project, ensure you have:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git (for installing julius from source)
- FFmpeg (installation instructions below)

### Step-by-Step Installation

#### Step 1: Clone or download this project

#### Step 2: Create a virtual environment
```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
# or
py -m venv venv

# Linux/macOS
python3 -m venv venv
```

#### Step 3: Activate the virtual environment
```bash
# Windows PowerShell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Windows Command Prompt
venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Linux/macOS
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Step 4: Install FFmpeg (Windows)
```powershell
# Using winget (recommended for Windows 10/11)
winget install --id Gyan.FFmpeg -e --source winget

# After installation, restart your terminal or PowerShell window
```

**For Linux/macOS**, see the System Dependencies section below.

#### Step 5: Install Python packages
```bash
# Install core packages first
pip install torch torchaudio

# Install julius from GitHub (important!)
pip install git+https://github.com/adefossez/julius.git

# Install whisperx and remaining dependencies
pip install whisperx
```

**Note**: The order matters! Installing julius from GitHub before WhisperX prevents compatibility issues.

#### Step 6: Verify installation
```bash
# Test FFmpeg
ffmpeg -version

# Test Python imports
python -c "import whisperx; import torch; print('Setup successful!')"
```

### Alternative: Install from requirements.txt
If you prefer, you can install all dependencies at once, but you'll need to install julius separately:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/adefossez/julius.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Always install julius from GitHub first to avoid the "No module named 'julius'" error.

## Usage

### Before Running the Script

Ensure the following are ready:
- ‚úÖ Virtual environment is activated (`(venv)` should appear in your terminal)
- ‚úÖ FFmpeg is installed and accessible (`ffmpeg -version` works)
- ‚úÖ You're in the project directory (`whisperx` folder)

### Basic Usage
```bash
python main.py <video_file_path>
```

### Examples
```bash
# Transcribe a video file
python main.py test.mkv

# Transcribe with custom output file
python main.py test.mkv -o my_transcription.txt

# Transcribe a video with spaces in the filename
python main.py "my video file.mp4"

# Disable sanitization (keep original confidential information)
python main.py test.mkv --no-sanitize
```

### Output Files

By default, the script creates **two output files**:

1. **Original transcription**: `video_name.txt` - Contains the raw transcription
2. **Sanitized transcription**: `video_name_sanitized.txt` - Contains transcription with confidential information replaced

### Command Line Options

- `video_path`: Path to the video file to transcribe (required)
- `-o, --output`: Custom output text file path (optional, default: `video_name.txt`)
- `--no-sanitize`: Disable sanitization and only create the original transcription file

## Privacy and Confidential Information

### Automatic Sanitization

The script automatically sanitizes confidential information in transcriptions by replacing sensitive terms with abbreviated codes. This helps protect privacy when sharing transcriptions.

**Default replacements:**
- "Anh ch·ªã" ‚Üí "AC"
- "Ki·∫øn th·ª©c" ‚Üí "KT"

### Reverse Sanitization (NEW!)

You can now restore sanitized text back to its original form using the reverse sanitization tool:

```bash
# Restore a sanitized file
python reverse_sanitize.py video_sanitized.txt

# Specify custom output location
python reverse_sanitize.py video_sanitized.txt -o restored_original.txt
```

**Output:** Creates a `video_restored.txt` file with original confidential information restored.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Only use this tool when you have authorization to access the original confidential information. The restored file should be kept secure.

### LLM Summarization with Ollama (NEW!)

Generate AI-powered summaries of your transcriptions while maintaining privacy protection:

#### Complete Pipeline (Recommended)

Process video ‚Üí transcribe ‚Üí sanitize ‚Üí summarize ‚Üí restore in one command:

```bash
# Full pipeline with default settings
python process_video_complete.py presentation.mp4

# Use different Ollama model
python process_video_complete.py meeting.mkv --model llama2

# Limit summary length
python process_video_complete.py video.mp4 --max-length 200
```

**Output files:**
- `video.txt` - Original transcription
- `video_sanitized.txt` - Sanitized transcription (safe to share)
- `video_summary_sanitized.txt` - Sanitized summary (safe to share)
- `video_summary_restored.txt` - Restored summary (confidential)

#### Step-by-Step Approach

```bash
# Step 1: Transcribe video
python main.py presentation.mp4

# Step 2: Summarize sanitized transcription
python summarize_with_ollama.py presentation_sanitized.txt
```

#### Privacy Protection in Summarization

```
Original: "Anh ch·ªã h·ªçc Ki·∫øn th·ª©c m·ªõi"
    ‚Üì (Sanitization)
Sanitized: "AC h·ªçc KT m·ªõi"
    ‚Üì (Sent to Ollama - No confidential info leaked!)
Summary: "Bu·ªïi h·ªçc gi·ªõi thi·ªáu AC v·ªõi KT"
    ‚Üì (Restoration)
Final: "Bu·ªïi h·ªçc gi·ªõi thi·ªáu Anh ch·ªã v·ªõi Ki·∫øn th·ª©c"
```

üîí **Key Point**: Ollama only processes sanitized text, ensuring confidential information never leaves your system in its original form.

**Prerequisites for Ollama:**
1. Install Ollama: https://ollama.com/download
2. Start service: `ollama serve`
3. Download model: `ollama pull llama3.2`

üìñ **For complete Ollama setup and usage, see:** [OLLAMA_SUMMARY_GUIDE.md](OLLAMA_SUMMARY_GUIDE.md)

### Customizing Confidential Terms

You can customize which terms to sanitize by editing the `confidential_terms.py` file:

```python
CONFIDENTIAL_TERMS = {
    r'Anh ch·ªã': 'AC',
    r'Ki·∫øn th·ª©c': 'KT',
    # Add your own terms:
    r'Your Secret Term': 'REPLACEMENT',
    r'Company Name': 'COMPANY',
}

# For advanced patterns (emails, phone numbers, etc.)
ADVANCED_PATTERNS = [
    (r'\b0\d{9}\b', '[PHONE]'),  # Vietnamese phone numbers
    (r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b', '[EMAIL]'),
]
```

### Disabling Sanitization

If you don't want to sanitize transcriptions, use the `--no-sanitize` flag:

```bash
python main.py video.mp4 --no-sanitize
```

This will only create the original transcription file without any replacements.

### Supported Video Formats

The script supports any video format that FFmpeg can process, including:
- MP4 (.mp4)
- MKV (.mkv)
- AVI (.avi)
- MOV (.mov)
- WMV (.wmv)
- FLV (.flv)
- And many more...

## GPU Support

The script automatically detects if a CUDA-compatible GPU is available:

- **With GPU**: Uses CUDA acceleration for faster transcription
- **Without GPU**: Falls back to CPU processing (slower but still functional)

To verify GPU support, the script will display the GPU information when it starts.

## Output

The script generates a text file containing the transcribed speech from the video. The output includes:

- Clean text transcription
- Automatic language detection
- Word-level alignment for accuracy

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. **"No module named 'julius'" Error**
**Problem**: The `julius` package fails to install properly through pip.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Install julius directly from GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/adefossez/julius.git
```

This installs version 0.2.8a1 from source, which resolves compatibility issues with newer Python versions.

#### 2. **FFmpeg Not Found Error: "[WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified"**
**Problem**: WhisperX cannot find FFmpeg to extract audio from video files.

**Solution for Windows**:

**Step 1**: Install FFmpeg using winget:
```powershell
winget install --id Gyan.FFmpeg -e --source winget
```

**Step 2**: After installation, you need to either:
- **Option A (Recommended)**: Restart your terminal/PowerShell window to load the new PATH
- **Option B**: The script has been modified to automatically add FFmpeg to PATH on Windows

**Step 3**: Verify FFmpeg is accessible:
```powershell
ffmpeg -version
```

**Note**: The `main.py` script now automatically adds the FFmpeg path for Windows users. If you installed FFmpeg in a custom location, update the path in `main.py`:
```python
ffmpeg_path = r"C:\Your\Custom\Path\To\FFmpeg\bin"
```

#### 3. **Virtual Environment Issues**
**Problem**: Python not found or packages not accessible after creating virtual environment.

**Solution**:
```powershell
# Always activate the virtual environment before running the script
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Or use the virtual environment Python directly
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py "your-video.mp4"
```

#### 4. **"GPU not available" message**
**Problem**: Script falls back to CPU (slower but still works).

**Solution** (Optional - for faster processing):
   - Ensure you have a CUDA-compatible NVIDIA GPU
   - Install CUDA toolkit from NVIDIA
   - Reinstall PyTorch with CUDA support:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
   ```
   - Verify installation with: `python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"`

#### 5. **Out of memory errors**
**Solution**:
   - Reduce the batch size in the script (change `batch_size=16` to a lower value like `8` or `4`)
   - Use a smaller model (change `"large-v2"` to `"base"` or `"small"` in line 64 of `main.py`)

#### 6. **Model download issues**
**Solution**:
   - Ensure you have a stable internet connection for the first run
   - The models are cached locally after the first download (~3GB for large-v2)
   - Models are stored in: `%USERPROFILE%\.cache\huggingface\`

#### 7. **Deprecation Warnings**
**Note**: You may see warnings about `pkg_resources` and `torchaudio` being deprecated. These are informational warnings and do not affect functionality. They can be safely ignored.

### Performance Tips

- Use GPU acceleration for faster processing
- For very long videos, consider splitting them into smaller chunks
- The "large-v2" model provides the best accuracy but requires more resources
- For faster processing with slightly lower accuracy, use "base" or "medium" models

## Known Issues and Workarounds

### Issue: Julius Package Installation Failure
**Description**: Installing `julius` via pip may fail or install incorrectly, causing import errors.

**Workaround**: Always install julius from GitHub source:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/adefossez/julius.git
```

### Issue: FFmpeg Not Found After Installation (Windows)
**Description**: Even after installing FFmpeg, Python subprocesses cannot find it.

**Workaround**: The script has been modified to automatically add FFmpeg to PATH on Windows. If issues persist:
1. Restart your terminal after installing FFmpeg
2. Verify FFmpeg is in PATH: `ffmpeg -version`
3. If using a custom FFmpeg installation path, update line 10 in `main.py`:
   ```python
   ffmpeg_path = r"C:\Your\Custom\FFmpeg\Path\bin"
   ```

### Issue: Virtual Environment Python Not Found
**Description**: After creating a virtual environment, `python` command not found.

**Workaround**: Use the direct path to Python executable:
```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py "your-video.mp4"
```

### Issue: Model Compatibility Warnings
**Description**: Warnings about model version mismatches (e.g., "Model was trained with pyannote.audio 0.0.1, yours is 3.4.0").

**Workaround**: These are informational warnings and can be safely ignored. The script will still function correctly, though you may experience slightly different results than with the original model versions.
