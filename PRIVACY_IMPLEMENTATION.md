# üîí Privacy Protection Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added automatic sanitization of confidential information from video transcriptions to protect sensitive data.

## What Was Added

### 1. Core Functionality (main.py)

#### New Features:
- **Dual output system**: Creates both original and sanitized transcription files
- **Regex-based replacement**: Uses regular expressions for flexible pattern matching
- **Configurable terms**: External configuration file for easy customization
- **Command-line control**: Optional flag to disable sanitization

#### Modified Functions:
```python
# Added import
import re

# New function
def sanitize_text(text)
    # Replaces confidential terms using regex patterns

# Modified function signature
def transcribe_video(video_path, output_path=None, sanitize=True)
    # Added sanitize parameter with default True
    # Creates both original and sanitized files
```

#### New Command-line Argument:
```bash
--no-sanitize    # Disables sanitization feature
```

### 2. Configuration File (confidential_terms.py)

**Purpose**: Centralized management of confidential terms

**Structure**:
```python
CONFIDENTIAL_TERMS = {
    r'Anh ch·ªã': 'AC',      # Simple term replacement
    r'Ki·∫øn th·ª©c': 'KT',
}

ADVANCED_PATTERNS = [
    # For complex patterns like emails, phone numbers, IDs
    (r'pattern', 'replacement'),
]
```

**Features**:
- Case-insensitive matching for CONFIDENTIAL_TERMS
- Support for advanced regex patterns
- Easy to extend and customize
- Commented examples for common patterns

### 3. Test Script (test_sanitization.py)

**Purpose**: Test sanitization without processing videos

**Features**:
- Demonstrates original vs sanitized text
- Shows all applied replacements
- Useful for testing new patterns
- Quick validation tool

### 4. Documentation

#### Updated README.md:
- Added privacy protection section
- Documented sanitization feature
- Usage examples with --no-sanitize flag
- Customization instructions

#### New PRIVACY_GUIDE.md:
- Quick reference for privacy features
- Best practices
- Common patterns (phone, email, IDs)
- Example workflow
- Tips and guidelines

### 5. Updated .gitignore
- Added pattern for sanitized files: `*_sanitized.txt`
- Prevents accidental commit of output files

## How It Works

### Workflow:
```
1. User runs: python main.py video.mp4
2. Script transcribes video
3. Saves original: video.txt
4. Applies sanitization patterns
5. Saves sanitized: video_sanitized.txt
6. Reports both file locations
```

### Sanitization Process:
```python
1. Load CONFIDENTIAL_TERMS and ADVANCED_PATTERNS
2. For each pattern in CONFIDENTIAL_TERMS:
   - Apply case-insensitive regex replacement
3. For each pattern in ADVANCED_PATTERNS:
   - Apply regex replacement (case-sensitive)
4. Return sanitized text
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (Default - Creates Both Files):
```bash
python main.py video.mp4
# Output:
#   - video.txt (original)
#   - video_sanitized.txt (safe to share)
```

### Disable Sanitization:
```bash
python main.py video.mp4 --no-sanitize
# Output:
#   - video.txt (original only)
```

### Test Sanitization:
```bash
python test_sanitization.py
# Shows: Original ‚Üí Sanitized comparison
```

## Default Protected Terms

| Vietnamese Term | Replacement | Reasoning |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Anh ch·ªã         | AC          | Common Vietnamese honorific |
| Ki·∫øn th·ª©c       | KT          | "Knowledge" - might be sensitive in context |

## Customization Guide

### Adding New Terms:

**Edit confidential_terms.py:**
```python
CONFIDENTIAL_TERMS = {
    r'Anh ch·ªã': 'AC',
    r'Ki·∫øn th·ª©c': 'KT',
    # Add yours:
    r'Company Secret': 'COMPANY',
    r'Project Name': 'PROJECT',
}
```

### Adding Advanced Patterns:

**For Phone Numbers:**
```python
ADVANCED_PATTERNS = [
    (r'\b0\d{9}\b', '[PHONE]'),  # Vietnamese: 0123456789
]
```

**For Email Addresses:**
```python
ADVANCED_PATTERNS = [
    (r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b', '[EMAIL]'),
]
```

**For ID Numbers:**
```python
ADVANCED_PATTERNS = [
    (r'\b\d{9}\b', '[ID]'),      # 9-digit ID
    (r'\b\d{12}\b', '[CCCD]'),   # 12-digit Vietnamese citizen ID
]
```

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Privacy Protection**: Automatically redacts sensitive information
‚úÖ **Flexibility**: Easy to customize patterns for different needs
‚úÖ **Safety**: Original file preserved, sanitized version safe to share
‚úÖ **Transparency**: Clear indication of what was replaced
‚úÖ **Efficiency**: Automatic processing, no manual editing needed
‚úÖ **Extensible**: Support for complex regex patterns

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**:
- Original files still contain sensitive information
- Always verify sanitized output before sharing
- Test patterns with sample data first
- Keep `confidential_terms.py` updated
- Don't share original `.txt` files
- Review sanitized files for completeness

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified:
- ‚úèÔ∏è `main.py` - Added sanitization feature
- ‚úèÔ∏è `README.md` - Added documentation
- ‚úèÔ∏è `.gitignore` - Added sanitized file pattern

### Created:
- üìÑ `confidential_terms.py` - Configuration file
- üìÑ `test_sanitization.py` - Test script
- üìÑ `PRIVACY_GUIDE.md` - Quick reference guide
- üìÑ `PRIVACY_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This document

## Testing

To test the feature:

1. **Test with sample text:**
   ```bash
   python test_sanitization.py
   ```

2. **Test with actual video:**
   ```bash
   python main.py your_video.mp4
   ```

3. **Verify both outputs:**
   - Check `your_video.txt` (should have original terms)
   - Check `your_video_sanitized.txt` (should have replacements)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Support for multiple replacement dictionaries (e.g., per-project)
- [ ] Logging of replacements made
- [ ] Custom replacement markers
- [ ] Batch processing mode
- [ ] GUI for pattern management
- [ ] Encryption for original files
- [ ] Diff viewer for original vs sanitized

## Conclusion

The privacy protection feature provides a robust, flexible system for automatically sanitizing confidential information from video transcriptions while preserving the original data for reference.
