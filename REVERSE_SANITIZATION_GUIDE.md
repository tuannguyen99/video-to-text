# üîÑ Reverse Sanitization Guide

## Overview

The reverse sanitization feature allows authorized users to restore sanitized transcriptions back to their original form, recovering the confidential information that was previously replaced.

## How It Works

```
Original Text          ‚Üí  Sanitization   ‚Üí  Sanitized Text
"Anh ch·ªã h·ªçc KT"          (Forward)         "AC h·ªçc KT"
                                                    ‚Üì
                                           Reverse Sanitization
                                                    ‚Üì
Restored Text          ‚Üê  Restoration    ‚Üê  Sanitized Text
"Anh ch·ªã h·ªçc KT"          (Backward)        "AC h·ªçc KT"
```

## Process Flow

### 1. Forward Process (Sanitization)
```bash
python main.py video.mp4
```
**Creates:**
- `video.txt` (original)
- `video_sanitized.txt` (confidential info replaced)

### 2. Reverse Process (Restoration)
```bash
python reverse_sanitize.py video_sanitized.txt
```
**Creates:**
- `video_restored.txt` (confidential info restored)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Restore a sanitized file
python reverse_sanitize.py meeting_sanitized.txt

# Output: meeting_restored.txt
```

### Custom Output Path
```bash
# Specify where to save restored file
python reverse_sanitize.py meeting_sanitized.txt -o confidential_original.txt
```

### Help Information
```bash
# Show all options
python reverse_sanitize.py --help
```

## Complete Example

### Step 1: Create Original Transcription
```bash
python main.py presentation.mp4
```
**Output:**
- `presentation.txt` - Original with confidential info
- `presentation_sanitized.txt` - Safe to share

### Step 2: Share Sanitized Version
Share `presentation_sanitized.txt` with team members who don't need access to confidential information.

### Step 3: Restore When Needed
```bash
python reverse_sanitize.py presentation_sanitized.txt
```
**Output:**
- `presentation_restored.txt` - Confidential info restored

### Step 4: Verify Restoration
```bash
python test_reverse_sanitization.py
```
Shows the complete cycle: Original ‚Üí Sanitized ‚Üí Restored

## Mapping Table

The restoration uses the same configuration from `confidential_terms.py`:

| Code | ‚Üê Restores To ‚Üí | Original Term |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| AC   | ‚Üê              | Anh ch·ªã       |
| KT   | ‚Üê              | Ki·∫øn th·ª©c     |

## Testing

### Test with Sample Data
```bash
python test_reverse_sanitization.py
```

**Shows:**
1. Original text
2. Sanitized version
3. Restored version
4. Verification (matches or differences)
5. Complete mapping table

### Expected Output
```
STEP 1: ORIGINAL TEXT
    Xin ch√†o Anh ch·ªã,
    H√¥m nay ch√∫ng ta s·∫Ω h·ªçc v·ªÅ Ki·∫øn th·ª©c m·ªõi.

STEP 2: SANITIZED TEXT
    Xin ch√†o AC,
    H√¥m nay ch√∫ng ta s·∫Ω h·ªçc v·ªÅ KT m·ªõi.

STEP 3: RESTORED TEXT
    Xin ch√†o Anh ch·ªã,
    H√¥m nay ch√∫ng ta s·∫Ω h·ªçc v·ªÅ Ki·∫øn th·ª©c m·ªõi.

‚úì SUCCESS: Restored text matches original!
```

## Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**
   - Only authorized personnel should use reverse sanitization
   - Keep restored files secure
   - Don't share restored files publicly

2. **File Management**
   - Restored files contain confidential information
   - Store in secure locations
   - Delete after use if no longer needed

3. **Audit Trail**
   - Track who restores sanitized files
   - Document reasons for restoration
   - Follow your organization's security policies

### üìù Case Sensitivity Note

The restoration process may differ in case from the original:
- **Original**: "anh ch·ªã" (lowercase)
- **Sanitized**: "AC"
- **Restored**: "Anh ch·ªã" (title case - using first pattern from config)

This is expected behavior and doesn't affect meaning.

## Configuration

### Current Mappings

Edit `confidential_terms.py` to modify mappings:

```python
CONFIDENTIAL_TERMS = {
    r'Anh ch·ªã': 'AC',     # Forward: Anh ch·ªã ‚Üí AC
    r'anh ch·ªã': 'AC',     # Reverse: AC ‚Üí Anh ch·ªã (first match)
    r'Ki·∫øn th·ª©c': 'KT',   # Forward: Ki·∫øn th·ª©c ‚Üí KT
    r'ki·∫øn th·ª©c': 'KT',   # Reverse: KT ‚Üí Ki·∫øn th·ª©c (first match)
}
```

### Adding New Terms

When adding terms, ensure they can be reversed:

```python
CONFIDENTIAL_TERMS = {
    # Good - unique code
    r'Secret Name': 'SN',
    
    # Bad - ambiguous code (avoid)
    r'Secret Name': 'S',
    r'Super New': 'S',  # Same code causes conflicts!
}
```

## File Naming Convention

| Original File | Sanitized File | Restored File |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| `video.txt` | `video_sanitized.txt` | `video_restored.txt` |
| `meeting.txt` | `meeting_sanitized.txt` | `meeting_restored.txt` |

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO

- Test restoration with `test_reverse_sanitization.py` before production use
- Keep `confidential_terms.py` consistent during sanitization and restoration
- Use unique codes for each confidential term
- Document when and why you restore files
- Secure restored files immediately after creation

### ‚ùå DON'T

- Share restored files with unauthorized personnel
- Use the same code for multiple different terms
- Restore files on shared/public computers
- Leave restored files in unsecured locations
- Forget to verify restoration accuracy

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Restoration Doesn't Match Original

**Cause**: Case sensitivity differences

**Solution**: This is expected. The restored text uses the first matching pattern from the configuration.

### Issue: Some Terms Not Restored

**Cause**: 
1. Term not in `confidential_terms.py`
2. Different configuration used during sanitization

**Solution**: 
1. Verify `confidential_terms.py` contains all terms
2. Use the same configuration file that was used during sanitization

### Issue: Code Conflicts

**Cause**: Multiple terms map to the same code

**Example:**
```python
CONFIDENTIAL_TERMS = {
    r'Term A': 'TA',
    r'Term Alpha': 'TA',  # Conflict!
}
```

**Solution**: Use unique codes for each term:
```python
CONFIDENTIAL_TERMS = {
    r'Term A': 'TA',
    r'Term Alpha': 'TAL',  # Unique code
}
```

## Integration Workflow

### For Teams

1. **Content Creator** (has access to confidential info):
   ```bash
   python main.py presentation.mp4
   # Share: presentation_sanitized.txt
   ```

2. **Team Members** (work with sanitized version):
   - Receive: `presentation_sanitized.txt`
   - Review, edit, analyze safely

3. **Authorized Reviewer** (needs to verify original):
   ```bash
   python reverse_sanitize.py presentation_sanitized.txt
   # Review: presentation_restored.txt
   # Delete after verification
   ```

## FAQ

**Q: Can I restore a file multiple times?**
A: Yes, restoration is repeatable and produces the same result.

**Q: Will restoration work if I change confidential_terms.py?**
A: Only if the same mappings exist. Use the original configuration for accurate restoration.

**Q: Is the restoration process reversible?**
A: Yes, you can sanitize a restored file again to get back to the sanitized version.

**Q: What happens to terms not in the configuration?**
A: They remain unchanged. Only configured codes are restored.

**Q: Can I automate restoration?**
A: Yes, the script returns exit code 0 on success, 1 on failure for automation.
